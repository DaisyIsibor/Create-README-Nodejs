## Description
The README Generator is a command-line tool built with Node.js that simplifies the creation of professional README files for new projects. It prompts users for essential project details such as title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, GitHub username, and email address. The tool automatically generates a well-structured README.md file based on the provided information, including sections like Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, Questions, and License. It also seamlessly integrates licensing information by allowing users to select a license from a curated list of options, generating a corresponding license badge and embedding a link to the full license text in the README.
